AAST,221,3,Contemporary In(queer)ies,"In her essay “Queer and Now,” Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick offers a rumination on the political, epistemological and pedagogical imports of “queer” at that moment: “ That’s one of the things that ‘queer’ can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren’t made (or can’t be made) to signify monolithically.” This 3 credit hour course, takes up Sedgwick’s suggestion of the possibilities of “queer” to consider the development of queer theory, queer studies, and queer politics. Although this course is organized thematically across a number of disciplines, it also resists a kind of stringent categorization or segmentation- mirroring the energy that has characterized this interdisciplinary field. While paying attention to the seemingly endless possibilities associated with queer theory, this course is profoundly committed to as Sedgwick argues to keep “same-sex sexual expression at “the terms definitional center,” as not to “dematerialize any possibility of queerness itself.”.",,,FS

For the ancients, myth was a religion, a means of alleviating common fears, a way of adding structure to the world, and a means of communicating values from one generation to the next. For literary authors and dramatists from ancient times to now, myth has provided a mechanism for conveying the desired message and image to the reader’s mind.

CL,323,3,"Alexander the Great, Then &amp; Now","In this course, students examine the vision and impact of Alexander the Great, whose military expedition to North Africa and the Middle East offers a model of a stable political structure on a global scale. Alexander’s activity ranged from Greece to India. The world he encountered was as foreign, diverse, strange and occasionally averse to his Western sensibilities as it is to us today. Yet, his vision was to overcome xenophobic tendencies (both among the conquering Greeks and the conquered people) and create a global and inclusive empire that was enriched by the different races, cultures, religions and civilizations it encompassed. This course is broad in scope and content and takes a global perspective regarding the factors of Alexander’s success, emphasizing the history and appreciation of the Humanities, rather than simply the ability to perform tasks at the written level. The study of Alexander’s achievement cultivates an appreciation of history and the Humanities on a practical level, while developing the students’ ability to deal with questions of values, ethics, and aesthetics on a global and historical level.",,,FS

Yet, in the course of time, the Greeks have developed their own particular civilization, which is characterized by tremendous inventions, discoveries and technological advancements that have impacted the Western world and its identity.

Class will be held at the archaeological sites themselves and the accompanying museums. Students will attend lectures on Greek culture, history, and art from prehistory to the modern age, and then visit the archaeological sites and the corresponding museums. The lectures will contextualize the site and the museum exhibits, since the purpose of museums is not only to preserve the material culture but also to display it in such a way as to enhance the content and bring to life aspects of the culture at hand. During each visit, therefore, students will survey both the site and the museum and assess how they make information available to the public, how they use interactive activities to stimulate visitors, and what aspects of the site and the museum succeed in presenting their subject in interesting and innovative ways or fail to do so. Students will also consider the struggle of traditional and well-established museums to re-invent themselves while their budgets are shrinking. This effort is most evident in Greek museums that have become very resourceful in re-organizing their displays at a minimum cost, as they attempt to remain relevant in a world accustomed to be intensely stimulated and entertained.",Students must be enrolled in the Museum Studies program (MUSM) and have completed at least two MUSM courses.,none,FS

Traditional managerial communication techniques do not apply to distributed teams, where in-person meetings may occur but are limited.  Further, even employees who are geographically co-located need to communicate and plan using virtual means.  Online collaboration tools provide opportunity for project success and will be covered, using examples and case studies from project management.  Social media tools offer exciting opportunities to improve team communication, efficiency, and success and will be discussed.

It is not a class about military strategy or foreign policy. Rather, we will survey the radiating impact of armed conflict and military service on individuals, communities, culture, and politics. And in the other direction, we will examine the ways fundamental features of American society (race, gender, class, citizenship, sexual orientation, and so on) influence the country’s military experience.   To give shape to such a vast subject, we will organize our inquiry around three questions: How do Americans mobilize for, fight, and remember their wars? Together those dimensions describe a society in the throes of militarization and perhaps militarism and/or anti-militarism. We will explore the difference between these ideas and assess which of them, if any, characterizes the United States in this period. These questions and terms will guide our main effort: to scrutinize the ways America’s experience with armed conflict has reflected and shaped broader truths about society in the past century.",,,FS

HY,332,3,Native American History,"This course examines the histories of hundreds of indigenous peoples in North America from early human habitation to the present day, with a focus on those residing in what is now the United States and Canada. We will study their experiences; their encounters with one another, Europeans, and Africans; and the different histories that people have told about those experiences and encounters. Class materials, which include art, film, and fiction as well as history and anthropology, stress the diversity of Native lifeways as well as the ways in which the history of American Indians has often been ignored, changed, appropriated, and distorted, as well as reclaimed and re-evaluated over time. Some of the questions we will consider throughout the semester include: How much can we know about Indigenous peoples before they had an alphabetic written history? What can European sources teach us about the Native peoples they encountered? How did the Natives of North America live before 1492? Does it make any sense to generalize about “Indians,” given that they include a large number of diverse peoples? How did contact with Europeans and Africans (and their diseases and technologies) change Native societies? How did Natives affect Europeans and Africans? Why did Native peoples lose ground (literally and figuratively) in the nineteenth century? How have Natives experienced and reacted to the changes of the twentieth century? What does it mean to be a Native person in the United States today?.",,,FS

HY,335,3,Handmade Nation: Knitting and History,"Knitting has enjoyed a huge comeback in the U.S. in the last decade, largely thanks to interest in DIY and environmentally sustainable consumption.

Half of class time will be studio-based and half will focus on discussion of the readings. There are no prerequisites. You will also develop the ability to think historically through critical analysis of primary and secondary sources; place events, people, and documents in their historical contexts; and create your own historical interpretations and narratives about the past. In this course, you should expect to do much more than memorize facts or dates -- you will be busy actively learning by knitting and doing history, not passively sitting back and being told what to think.",,,FS
HY,337,3,Foodways in American History,"The broad goal of this class is to introduce students to the use of food, eating, and the ways in which various societies have met these challenges.

We will review key historical phenomena that distinguish contemporary China, particularly Marxist and Stalinist theories and their use by the CCP in varying circumstances not only to purse and carry out political revolution (1921-1949) but also political-economic developments after 1949. Such developments initially involved PRC state formation via agricultural transformation &amp; large-scale Soviet-style industrialization accompanied by bureaucratization, the oppositional anti-bureaucratic thrust that eventually produced the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the rebuilding of both the CCP &amp; PRC after Mao’s death in 1976, the “second Communist Revolution” after 1978 associated with Deng Xiaoping, and the places of “intellectuals” in all of this.",,,FS

HY,346,3,Epidemics! A History of Medicine,"The history of medicine is the history of disease. Plague, bloody flux, yellow fever, the flu, cholera, ebola, smallpox, AIDS — at one time or another, each of these terms inspired terror. They’ve entered our otherwise flourishing civilizations and, like a wildfire, cut down men, women, children, rich, poor, religious, non-believers, even the healers themselves. Like phantoms, they disappeared as fast as they came; but once introduced to these mysterious visitors, no society remained unchanged. In this history of medicine, we examine six major epidemics over the last three thousand years. We’ll then turn to three epidemics of the present: cancer, healthcare-associated infections, and bioterrorism. How have humans responded to these threats? How has medicine adapted, if it has? What are our triumphs and when have we been unable to stop our invisible adversaries?.",,,FS

HY,370,3,"A History of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800","In what ways did the Atlantic Ocean resemble an early-modern super-highway, moving people, ideas, and products across its waters? How did the individuals who shaped this world – rebellious slaves, elite planters, Aztec emperors, wayward sailors, Kongolese kings, infamous pirates and radical revolutionaries – contribute to the creation of this vibrant and dynamic world? A History of the Atlantic World answers these questions by tracing four centuries of interactions among Europeans, Africans and Native Americans, from the first European forays down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, to the turbulent Age of Revolutions at the close of the eighteenth century.",,,FS

HY,379,3,History of Modern Argentina,"From the time of its incorporation into the Spanish Empire, the land now known as Argentina has held out the promise of fabulous wealth and opportunity.  This potential made Argentina the foremost destination of European immigrants to Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, during which time it became one of the wealthiest nations in the world.  Many Argentines have anxiously awaited the day when their nation would be included among the ranks of “first world” or “civilized” nations, and they take great pride in their adoption and adaptation of European culture.  However, Argentina’s history has not always been so rosy.  Political violence, economic catastrophe, and social unrest define the modern Argentine experience as much as economic prosperity, industrialization, and the development of a rich and dynamic culture.   From the gauchos (Argentine cowboys) of the vast Pampas to the smoke-filled tango parlors, immigrant tenements, and factories of Buenos Aires, Argentina offers a fascinating case for examining the creation and sustainment of identity and nationality in Latin America.",,,FS
HY,382,3,Early Modern Britain,"England was transformed during the early modern period. In the sixteenth century, England saw the Reformation, the beginnings of the British Empire, the educational revolution, the rise of humanism, the growth of the state, the last feudal rebellions, and the explosion of urbanization; then, divided by a civil war that pitted monarch against Parliament, seventeenth-century England saw the foundation of institutions and ideas that shape our world to this day. We will study some of the most compelling figures of British history: the insatiable Henry VIII and his brilliant daughter, Elizabeth I; the driven Oliver Cromwell and the ‘merry monarch’ Charles II; writers like Shakespeare, Milton, Margaret Cavendish, and Aphra Behn; explorers Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake; thinkers such as Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke; But we will also look at larger social and cultural forces that shaped early modern England, including the rise of literacy, a sharpening economic stratification, new understandings of magic and witchcraft, gender roles, the growth of the common law system, and the politics of migration.",,,FS

What Makes This an Honors Class? This course will ask students to make big connections about a critical time in history. We will examine some of the seminal texts in Anglo-American culture, and we will study foundational changes in British and American law, politics, and society. More than anything, though, this class will push you to answer the why questions about this history: why did people assent to the Reformation? Why did a Civil War break out? And, perhaps most importantly, why was this question so important: which do you fear more, tyranny or anarchy?   In doing so, students will be asked to do extra, independent research for all essay questions. They will also be asked to write a reflective piece at the end of the course about these very questions.",,,FS

It also explores the broader view – the general context of “holy war” down to c. 1100; tensions between the ideal and reality of crusading; the social and cultural impact of the crusades, for good and ill; the Muslim perception of the “Franj” as both invaders and neighbors, and the long afterlife of the crusades down through the early modern period. Later sessions of the course then turn to the range of contested historiographical issues that have characterized the study of the crusades in recent years.

Topics such as the structural role of agencies in the separation of powers, presidential control of agencies, the Administrative Procedure Act, judicial review of agency action, agency adjudication and enforcement, and private enforcement of statutory duties would be left for Administrative Law and related electives; topics such as justiciability, the separation and balance of powers (and specific discussion of Article I, Article II, and Article III powers), due process, and equal protection would be left for Constitutional Law and related electives, Nor would the proposed course be about the sausage-making of the legislative process (e.g., lobbying and lobbying regulations, campaign finance law, First Amendment issues, and so on). The first-year Constitutional Law course and upper-level electives in administrative law, legislative process, election law, and advanced constitutional law would not be preempted. The proposed first-year course would instead provide a grounding in the writing, interpretation, and application of both statutes and regulations - ideally at both the federal and state level. This would necessarily include some aspects of the legislative process - for example, the role of conference committees, who prepare authoritative reports on why specific language made it into the final version of a bill, and the use of legislative history by courts. It would also necessarily include some aspects of the administrative law process -particularly the role of agencies, state and federal, in writing regulations that implement statutes, and the role of courts in applying Chevron and Skidmore deference in interpreting regulations. The course would also cover the canons of statutory interpretation and canvass various big picture approaches to statutory interpretation - originalism, textualism, dynamic interpretation, purposivism, and the like. The course would be trans-substantive, teaching students the tricks of the trade in interpreting and applying statutes and regulations in a range of areas. The course may therefore preempt the current upper-division course on statutory interpretation.",,,FS

Along the way, other important topics in moral philosophy will be discussed.",,,FS
PHL,230,3,Political Philosophy,"This course serves as an introduction to central debates in political philosophy.  The major questions we explore are the following: How can the coercive authority the government exercises over its citizens be justified? What does justice require in our society today? What role do democracy, freedom, rights and equality play in our understanding of a just society? Through the study of both historical and contemporary texts, we investigate these topics. We also consider how these issues bear upon debates in the contemporary American context concerning the following: restrictions on free speech, participation in the democratic process, the war on drugs, homelessness, education and socioeconomic inequality.",,,FS
PHL,234,3,Social Philosophy,"How should we live together? In this course, we seek to answer this question through moral assessment of the institutional rules and cultural norms that shape our interaction with others and the world around us. We specifically consider issues in the following two categories: I. Markets &amp; consumption. In the modern-day economy, we must grapple with important issues concerning the responsibilities of individual consumers and corporations, what goods may be legitimately bought and sold in a free market, and how economic transactions between nations should be structured to count as fair. II. Violence. One of the features thought to make the state distinctive is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of force. Given this power, we will examine the legitimate use of violence by the government. Is the death penalty justified? Is the use of torture permissible under any circumstances? How should it deal with terrorists as opposed to traditional combatants in war?.",,,FS

At least one prior course in philosophy is strongly recommended.",,,FS
PHL,243,3,Philosophical Issues in Constitutional Law,"This is a course exploring major issues in the philosophy of constitutional law. Generally constitutional law is concerned with what powers and responsibilities governments have as well as what the limits on those powers might be, including civil rights. In doing so, constitutions guide official determinations of what counts as legally valid within the relevant jurisdiction. Topics might include debates over the proper way to interpret constitutions, whether constitutions must (or should) be written documents, whether they are necessary (or desirable) in a democracy, the relation between principles of legality set forth in constitutions and moral principles (especially the relation between legal rights and moral rights), and the advisability of official bodies tasked with interpreting and applying the constitution such as the Supreme Court.",,,FS

As customers, employees, employers, business owners, and simply as members of a community, we stand in important business relevant relations to others, for which it is appropriate to ask questions about the ethical status of our actions.  Are we acting in ethically appropriate ways?  To answer this we need to know what principles should govern our actions and what justifies those principles.

PHL,343,3,Philosophical Issues in International Law,"This course explores philosophical issues that arise with respect to the international law. Some of these are conceptual. For instance, what qualifies as ‘international law’ and in virtue of what characteristics? International laws, norms, and rule-mediated practices are different in character from the laws that govern our lives within the state. Who makes international laws, and who enforces them? A host of normative issues arise with respect to international law too. What if anything gives international legal bodies like the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization rightful authority over those who are taken to be bound by their rules? In cases of conflict, do the laws of states trump international laws or vice-versa?  We will consider some of the ethical issues surrounding international laws, treaties, and conventions concerning some of the following issues: human rights; war, humanitarian intervention and the use of violence more broadly; trade and economic globalization; the environment and the use of natural resources; immigration and refugees; and intellectual property.

PHL,388,3,Art and Human Nature,"The arts are seemingly found in all human cultures.  Why is this so?  Is art deeply embedded in what we might call “human nature”?  Philosophers have long thought about the arts in terms of human nature.  More recently, there are proposals that we can think about the arts “naturalistically” in terms of what the biological and human sciences tell us about human nature, and the very human tendencies to make and appreciate art of all kinds.  This naturalistic turn requires philosophical thinking first about how we should conceive art; second, how we can interpret and evaluate art, and third, how it functions in a variety of cultural and environmental contexts.

Throughout U.S. history, it is difficult to identify major examples of policy change that were not spurred by social movement activity.

PSC,466,3,The Politics of Poverty,"In this course we will examine one of the most enduring social problems in the United States – poverty. The course is divided into three sections. In the first section, we will primarily focus on the conceptualization and measurement of poverty, as well as the demographic groups that are most likely to suffer from high poverty rates. In the second part of the course, we will review in detail the major government programs aimed at alleviating poverty. We will examine their historical development, their structure and the social science research on their effectiveness. In the third section of the course we will review alternative explanations for poverty, focusing on the distinction between individual and structural explanations and how it influences public discourse and the politics of poverty.  As this is an upper level course that fulfills the university’s writing requirement, there will be a significant amount of writing in this class. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.",,,FS
PSC,467,3,The Conservative Movement in America,"This class will examine the origins and history of the conservative political movement in the United States, following the development of this ideology from its origins as a small movement of journalists and intellectuals to the dominant ideology of the Republican Party, and ultimately, for a time, the dominant ideology in the United States.  This class will focus primarily on texts written from a conservative or right-wing perspective.  That said, the purpose of this class is not indoctrination. Students are encouraged to engage in vigorous, respectful class discussions on the ideas presented, noting any weaknesses perceived in the arguments considered.  Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.",,,FS

We pride ourselves on the idea that all Americans, regardless of race, gender, class level or other demographic characteristics, have a chance to live the American Dream of getting a good job, owning your own home and creating a successful and satisfying life.  This course will examine whether equal opportunity is a reality in America, and what effect the law and public policy have on equal opportunity. Writing proficiency within the discipline is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student in this discipline will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.",PSC 101,,FS
PSC,472,3,Law in Everyday Life:   Theory &amp; Application,"Law is traditionally studied vocationally.  That is, students of the law often learn about it strategically, in order to eventually write legislation, advocate for a client, or decide cases.  In this class, students will be introduced to a different way of studying law, one rooted in the interdisciplinary field of legal studies (sometimes known as “law and society”) that draws on knowledge, methodologies, and critical theories from several disciplines.  Rather than studying law as an enterprise that operates autonomously, this course introduces students to the study of law as an object that cannot be understood apart from the social, political, and cultural contexts in which it exists, to include race and ethnicity, social class, gender, sexual orientation, and nationality.  With these goals in mind, this course will explore how law permeates human life and, conversely, how human life permeates law.     As this course is one that satisfies the “W” requirement, writing proficiency within this discipline is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course.",,,FS

PSC,613,3,State Politics and Policy,"In this course we will examine theories and related research on state government and the policymaking process in the U.S. states. The course is divided into three parts. For approximately the first third of the semester, we will examine a fairly representative set of readings which span a broad range of political institutions through which policy is made. These institutions include the office of the governor, the state legislature, the state judicial system, and the various practices of direct democracy across the states. Part two of the course will be spent studying theories of the state policy process. We will examine a variety of theories, reflecting a broad range of forces that are thought to play a significant role in shaping state policy outcomes. As we will see, despite the complex and seemingly idiosyncratic nature of the policymaking process,   state politics scholars have identified many systematic relationships between various institutional and contextual variables, and state policy outcomes. The insights that have been generated from this literature not only contribute to our understanding of state policymaking, but in many cases they shed light on debates that are relevant to scholars of American (national) politics, or in some cases, comparative politics. In the final section of the course, we will examine research in several substantive policy areas which have traditionally been considered the domain of the states. Our emphasis in this section will be broadened to include not just studies of policy adoption, but studies of policy implementation and impact as well.",,,FS
PSC,614,3,Race and American Politics,"Despite the passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965) fifty years ago, and the recent election of an African American president in 2008, racial inequality persists across many dimensions of American life, including earnings, wealth, educational and occupational attainment, health and longevity, and access to political power and influence. Despite claims of a “post-racial” America, the events in Ferguson, Missouri and the recent movement that they have sparked, serve to remind us that racial inequality and its impact on race relations continue to play a central role in American politics. Today, African Americans and Latinos comprise approximately a quarter of the U.S. population. In many cities and some states, white Anglo citizens actually comprise a minority of the population, and demographic projections over the next two decades suggest that the white share of the population will continue to    decline. Thus, it seems clear that race relations will remain central to understanding American politics at all levels of government in the years to come.  In this course we will examine theories and related research on the role of race relations and racial stratification in American politics. The course is divided into four major sections. The first section of the course examines theories of racial prejudice. In this section we will examine some of the most important debates in the literature, including the possible existence and precise definition of a “new racism,” innovations regarding the measurement of prejudice to overcome social desirability bias, and the effects of increasing diversity on racial attitudes and race relations. In part two of the course we will examine the effects of racial attitudes on political behavior. We will examine the effects of race and prejudice on vote choice, the role of racial attitudes in the growth and success of the Republic Party in the South in recent decades, racial framing effects and the effects of the use of racial “code words” in campaigns and the mass media, and the role that racial attitudes have played in evaluations of and support for Barack Obama. In part three of the course, we turn out attention to the causes and consequences of the election of minority elected officials. What factors contribute to the success of black and Latino candidates in elections? And what difference does it make? In this section we will examine the debate over the importance of minority descriptive representation in advancing minority interests, as well as the effects of the increasing diversification of elected officials on other aspects of American politics. In the final section of the course, we will examine the importance of race in the policy process. We begin by examining theories and evidence of the influence of race relations in policy design and policy adoption. We then turn our attention to the importance of race in policy implementation and policy outcomes.",,,FS

""Traditions"" means a series of loosely connected ontological, epistemological and normative propositions: claims as to what the world is made of, how it can be understood, and what the work of scholarship could or should be.  These propositions are interwoven in a variety of ways that make them hard to unravel.

They are made even more so by the fact that they are intercut with a variety of different methodologies to form highly disparate research programs.

It encapsulates the Renaissance spirit of eloquence, and four hundred years after its publication, it remains the most frequently used translation of the Bible in the English-speaking world, especially in America. Given the historical, political, literary, and cultural prominence of this translation, this course takes a transdisciplinary approach to understanding how the book came into existence and what accounts for its popularity. The course begins by studying the complex history of how this translation came to be commissioned, who the translators were, how the translation was accomplished, and the politics involved in the translation. The course then critically studies the structures and styles of the KJB, with particular focus on examining genres and performing close readings of texts, as well as considering the political work often attributed to the text (i.e., how the book has been used to enslave and emancipate enslaved people, how it has been used to create and maintain patriarchy, etc). The course ends by paying particular attention to the history of the KJB in the United States, as we discuss the so-called “KJB-Only Movement.” Therefore, rather than studying Jewish or Christian theology, this course aims to introduce students to issues surrounding the material book history of the KJB, its immense literary aesthetic, and its cultural influence.",,UH 200 (concurrent enrollment allowed),FS
UH,244,3,Antiquity to Modernity,"This course examines the impact of the ancient world on the life of modern women. More specifically, we examine the evolution of women’s life, starting from ancient Greece (where we have the most complete evidence from sources) and following its trajectory to the modern day. Ancient Greece, known for catapulting civilization to higher levels with its invention of democracy, political science, philosophy, the codification of laws and the professionalization of medicine among other achievements, shaped the world, for better or worse, as we know it today. This same culture, however, has excluded women from public life since the 5th century BC and has set the stage for pioneer women in the West to combat the perception of females as inferior beings and to struggle to enter higher education and public life and, eventually, gain voting rights. This socio-political framework helps us explore the gender ideologies that have impacted women’s life since antiquity, the changes in the perception of women in the course of history, the origin and development of ideas about women’s body and mind, as well as the role of race in regard to these issues. Understanding the gamut of theories and attitudes toward women, we can develop a better grasp of what women want today, where they are headed, what obstacles are still standing in their way and how they can overcome them to achieve their goals.",,UH 200 (concurrent enrollment allowed),FS

In this course, students will examine how the concept of Africa, as both home and identity, is recreated and imagined through a variety of disciplines and sources (history, sociology, religion, art, media studies, anthropology, psychology, linguistics). During lectures and weekly discussions, and through words, pictures, sounds, and live performance we’ll examine objects and stories that collectively make up contemporary expressions of global Africanity. Students will explore questions of home, identity, Afropolitanism, continuity, appropriation, authenticity, historical memory, and creolization using examples from academic scholars, literary figures, and popular culture. Looking and listening closely, students will observe the wide range of African cultural practices present within literature, film, music, artwork, communication styles, dress, and beauty standards to develop a critical understanding of not only how these practices continue to unfold on the African continent, but how they are also transformed by and endure throughout its many diasporas.",,UH 200 (concurrent enrollment allowed),FS

UH,282,3,Imagining Revolution,"This course surveys various examples of the revolutionary and radical imagination. Instead of comparing different historical revolutions, this course will be exploring the different ways that people have imagined, in a revolutionary sense, alternative worlds.  What does restless discontent with what-is look like in literature and art?  In philosophy?  In politics?  In religion?  In race and gender?  By tracing the contours of such thoughts, we can begin, first, to see the power of critique and ask ourselves questions such as: Critique what?  Critique why?  Critique how?  And secondly, we can begin to see the power of the speculative imagination and its role in creating a more desirable, and just, world.",,UH 200 OR BUI 102 OR GBA 271 OR GBA 272 OR IDMD 102 OR RRS 201 OR (UFE 201 AND UFE 202),FS

The course considers the possibility that, beyond entertainment value, representations of college convey a perceived reality of what student and faculty life looks like as well as the status of higher education in the United States. We will question those portrayals and discuss how they inform and/or miseducate various populations by comparing them with the everyday realities of students, faculty, and institutions in order for you to become a more critical consumer of the media and public messages you consume.",UH 200,,FS
UH,311,3,Stanley Kubrick and Human Nature,"Stanley Kubrick said in an interview for Full Metal Jacket that ""truth is too multifaceted to be contained in a five line summary"", but here's to trying. Stanley Kubrick, director of such notable films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and the aforementioned Full Metal Jacket, among others, was an inveterate reader who practically could not make a film until he was an expert on the subjects he was dealing with. As such, this course will take a similarly broad approach, drawing on theoretical works from philosophy, psychology, social criticism and others, to help us study the one true subject Kubrick was eternally a student of--human nature. Is there such a thing, and what features define it? Like Danny Torrance in The Shining, we'll draw on knowledge from the past, present and, though we can't ""shine"", from potential futures, to work our way through the labyrinthian mystery that is the human race.",UH 200,,FS
UH,312,3,Fear and the American Consciousness,"This course seeks to answer two questions: “What do Americans fear, and what can we learn about American culture after studying that fear?” Americans have always, and perhaps now more than ever, maintained deep fear. Fear of the unknown. Of science. Of technology. Of others. Of terrorism. Of gun violence. Of viruses. Of each other. Answering such questions demand a transdisciplinary approach to fear. Therefore, students will use trauma theory, psychology, science, race theory, historical analysis, philosophy, rhetoric studies, sociology, film criticism, and gender theory to analyze fear from a variety of disciplines. The class is organized around a series of texts that depict and address American fears since the Great Depression, and students will be asked to analyze and then debate the causes of such fears.

Students shall focus on spy novels, possibly including the works of Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham, Alan Furst, Graham Greene and John le Carre to develop the spy storyteller’s craft. The texts students shall read will grapple with the moral questions raised in espionage—the manipulation of other human beings, its justification for protecting the national interests of one’s country, the long-term corrosive effects of deceit and clandestinity on the soul of the spymaster, the role of the spy bureaucracy, and the attraction of the game of espionage for its own sake.  The works of fiction will be contrasted with the true lives of master spies, possibly including Oleg Penkovsky and Ryszard Kuklinski, as well as double agents— possibly including Dusko Popov, Kim Philby, Aldrich Ames, Robert Hannsen, and Jim Nicholson, posing the question whether the myth of espionage is stranger than the real thing.",UH 200,,FS

By breaking the boundaries of race and gender, as they are traditionally drawn by existential philosophy, and by including writers such as Ralph Ellison, Frantz Fanon, and Toni Morrison, a richer conversation on the nature of the human condition, as well as the possibilities for “being”, will be presented. The course’s primary objective is to read existential philosophy across race and gender. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.

Should the concept of love serve as a starting point for thinking politically?  Or should it, above all other things, be avoided as a starting point for thinking politically?  These are just some of the questions that the tradition of political theory, stretching back to Plato’s Republic, has sought to answer in many different ways.  In this course, we will explore such questions and some of the ways that they have been approached by various writers. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.

How do we alter our value systems to better reflect environmentally sustainable behaviors?  Do we pursue revolution or reform?  In this course, we will survey the spectrum of Green political theories, including eco-liberalism, eco-socialism, eco-anarchism, eco-feminism, eco-terrorism, etc., and explore the myriad ways people have rethought our present and future politics in relation to our environments.

UH,349,3,The Neighbor,"“Love your neighbor as yourself.”  Why?  Do they deserve it?  And who is my neighbor?  When Christ was asked, “Who is my neighbor?” a line of questioning was begun that has since populated the writings of authors such as Augustine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Soren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Sigmund Freud to contemporary thinkers such as Cornel West and Slavoj Zizek.  It is an ethic that has been both celebrated and critiqued.  In either form, we will see that the category of “the neighbor” provides a productive starting point to begin thinking politically, economically, psychologically, and theologically.  In this class, we will examine classic texts that engage the concept of love of the neighbor in order to trace its historical development as a social and political concept.

This course disrupts Gilroy’s thesis, repositioning the focus, temporally and spatially, eastward. Students will examine often underexplored relations and routes of passage and exchange between the African continent and the peoples of Japan, China, India, the Pacific Islands, the Middle East, among other nations.

WS,375,3,Freedom Beyond Rights,"Feminism understands itself to be fundamentally liberatory - that is, concerned with increasing liberty, particularly (but not exclusively) of women. Feminist political theory often treats freedom within a liberal framework that prioritizes individual rights: for example, the right to control one’s reproductive health, the right to equal pay, or the right not to experience harassment. According to this framework, to be free is to enjoy one’s rights without interference or limitation. The aim of this course is to think about freedom beyond rights. Specifically, we will consider what it means to be a free political actor, whether freedom is the highest political good, whether, and how, freedom is compatible with other values, such as equality and justice, and how different kinds of politics, social norms, and modes of living might affect attempts to increase and experience freedom.",,,FS

WS,420,3,Women On Screen,"This course wrestles with concerns and key debates that surround the place of women in film and television and the questions that gender studies raises about representation, consumption, authorship, and spectatorship. To enter these debates, we will examine the role of women both in front of and behind the camera predominantly through U.S. media history, although notable developments in global cinema (particularly in terms of female directing) will be addressed. While film history and criticism will be the background for course discussions, the main objective is to consider more broadly how women have acted as consumers and viewers of popular media including television, how they have been portrayed in mainstream U.S. culture, and how they have created their own representations of gendered experience. Particular attention will be paid to how other identities such as those based in race, class, sexuality, and age have intersected with gender to inform both consumers and creators of visual media.",,,FS
WS,425,3,Monsters in Popular Culture,"This interdisciplinary seminar will critically engage with the concept of the monstrous ""Other"" from the perspectives of gender and race studies. Examining a variety of texts--from films, television, and works of literature to police reports, psychology texts, and medieval manuscripts--this course will explore how the monster has been constructed historically and culturally as a defining opposition, the Other against which the dominant or privileged defines itself. What lies outside of, what must be expelled from, what needs to be repressed in dominant culture is figured in or inconveniently rises up as the ""monster."" He/she both haunts and polices the boundaries of normative sexuality, the gender binary, and racial privilege. In this course, we will read critical, historical, and theoretical material as a lens through which to critique primary texts, or what one might call our monstrous examples (from American Horror Story to Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher""). As a seminar, this highly interactive course enables students to critically engage with content in responsible ways and is designed to explore interdisciplinary approaches to a particular issue, theme, or problem. Within this format, students can expect a reading- and discussion-intensive course with opportunities for self-directed inquiry as well as collaborative work.",,,FS

WS,570,3,Transnational Feminisms,"Transnational Feminisms is a contemporary paradigm of study that moves beyond international conceptions of feminism to think across national borders by interrogating the intersections of nationality, race, gender, class, and sexuality in the context of global capitalism.  This field works to decolonize the contested terrain of knowledge production upon gendered subjectivites are constituted and reconstituted within global relations of power and privilege.  While globalization relies upon the heightened mobility of bodies, capital, commodities, technologies, and conceptual imaginaries across borders, it simultaneously requires the reconfiguration and reconstitution of the state, its bordering practices, and colonial and national hierarchies of social-spatial relations and their attendant binaries—self-other, first world-third world, traditional-modern, private-public, citizen-noncitizen. While a richly theoretical field, transnational feminisms provocatively engages with a feminist politics and practice attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and one with longstanding ties to colonialism, racism and imperialism. As such, it resists utopic ideas about ""global sisterhood"" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.",,,FS
